### MasterThesis
Using Deep Neural Networks to Price Basket and Rainbow Options
Status from the 21.07.2019
Work has been done by me, Christian Gruener, University of Stuttgart, 2862152.

For running the files the following packages have to be installed:
datetime, os, loggingï¼Œpandas, numpy, tensorflow, matplotlib, scipy, time.

For the implementation Python 3.6 was used. 

# In this git you can find the following files:

# Standalone Files Python files:
- Monte-Carlo+Euler-Maruyama for the Euler-Maruyama Method described in section 
- Monte-Carlo_explicit:
  Explicit solution for Basket and Rainbow Option with 10 dimensions from section

# The Deep Neural Network:
Consisting of the files: main + myproblems
- for usage run the main file and choose your problem
